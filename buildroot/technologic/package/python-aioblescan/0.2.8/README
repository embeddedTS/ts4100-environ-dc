Patches here are applied to 0.2.8 sources only, this effectively bumps the package to rev 0.2.9 which is needed to fix a bug with Eddystone beacons. If upstream Buildroot ever updates to 0.2.9+ then this folder can be removed.

0003 is also a patch to not have the .decode() function return early so we can get the MAC and RSSI from that single packet.
